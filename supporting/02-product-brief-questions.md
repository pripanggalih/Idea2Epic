## Scope Definition Framework

### In Scope Checklist
Ask for each proposed feature:
- [ ] Does this directly solve the core problem?
- [ ] Is this essential for the primary user?
- [ ] Can we launch without this? If yes, consider moving to "out of scope"
- [ ] Do we have clarity on what this means?

### Out of Scope Categories
Common items to explicitly exclude:
- Future phases / "nice to haves"
- Edge case handling (for v1)
- Platform variations (e.g., "mobile app later")
- Integrations (unless core to value)
- Admin/back-office features (unless essential)
- Advanced customization options

### Scope Creep Warning Signs
🚩 "While we're at it, we could also..."
🚩 "It would be cool if..."
🚩 "Competitors have X, so we need X"
🚩 "What if users want to..."
🚩 Features without clear user stories

| **Competitive** | Can competitors respond quickly? |
| **Regulatory** | Are there legal/compliance concerns? |
| **Adoption** | Will users actually change behavior? |

### Risk Evaluation Matrix

|--------------------------|-----|--------|------|
| **High** | Monitor | Mitigate | Avoid/Transfer |
| **Medium** | Accept | Monitor | Mitigate |
| **Low** | Accept | Accept | Monitor |
