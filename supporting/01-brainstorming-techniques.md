## 3. "What If" Scenarios

Challenge assumptions with these prompts:

- What if we had unlimited budget?
- What if we had to launch in 1 week?
- What if our biggest competitor copied this tomorrow?
- What if our target user was 10 years older/younger?
- What if we removed the most "essential" feature?
- What if we had to charge 10x the price?
- What if this had to work offline?
- What if we could only use voice/no screen?

## 4. Reverse Brainstorming

Instead of "How do we solve X?", ask:
1. "How could we make X worse?"
2. "How could we cause X to fail?"
3. Then reverse each answer into a solution.

**Example:**
- Problem: "How to improve customer satisfaction?"
- Reverse: "How to make customers hate us?"
  - Make them wait forever → Solution: Reduce wait times
  - Ignore their complaints → Solution: Responsive support
  - Make product confusing → Solution: Simplify UX

## 5. Mind Mapping Structure

Start from center, branch out:

```
                    [Feature A]
                   /
    [User Need 1]--[Feature B]
   /               \
[CORE IDEA]         [Feature C]
   \
    [User Need 2]--[Feature D]
                   \
                    [Feature E]
```

**Rules:**
- One word/short phrase per branch
- Use colors for different themes
- Connect related ideas across branches
- No judgment during creation

## 6. 5 Whys Technique

4. **Why** is [Answer 3] happening? → [Answer 4]

## 7. Random Word Association

1. Pick a random word (noun works best)
2. List attributes of that word
3. Force connections to your problem

**Example:**
- Random word: "Restaurant"
- Attributes: Menu, reservations, chef, courses, tips
- Problem: "Improve onboarding"
- Connections:
  - Menu → Offer choices in onboarding path
  - Reservations → Schedule personalized sessions
  - Courses → Break into digestible steps
  - Tips → Add helpful hints throughout
